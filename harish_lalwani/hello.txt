Hi everyone

git checkout -b tanya origin/tanya -  this means that we are creating a
branch name tanya in our local, and this local branch will be in sync with remote
branch tanya
Above command you will do only one time, when this branch is not in your local.

git checkout harish - This command will switch to the local branch harish.
This you will do only when you have this branch available in local

git checkout <branch_name> -- To switch to branch in your local repo.

Adding few more commits to understand branches.
Now after you have created the branch, you will not see 
the changes in master
branch, unless you merge your branch with master
